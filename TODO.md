1. Get the tebd circuit and noise model behaviour working correctly.
2. Add unit tests for all of those tebd functions.
3. Improve the way that the prebuilt channels are made to reduce duplication.
4. Check if there is duplication between run_circuit and run_compiled_circuit and try to remove this.
5. Add doc strings, in a lot of detail to all exported functions.
